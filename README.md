# Synergy between noisy quantum computers and scalable classical deep learning

This folder contains data from the article referenced above. The data are related to the plots in Fig.7.
It also includes the angles of the quantum circuits and the indices of the physical qubits. They can be used as input features for the neural network.

The loader.py file is used to load these data.
